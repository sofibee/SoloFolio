SoloFolio
=========
SoloFolio is the complete portfolio & blog solution, powered by WordPress.

USING THE GALLERY

SoloFolio replaces the built-in WordPress gallery shortcode. Simply use
the built-in WordPress gallery manager to build your portfolios.

INSTALLATION STEPS

1. Copy theme files to wp-content/themes
2. Activate theme in Appearance > Themes
3. In Appearance > Customize, set color scheme, logo URL (from media library),
and contact information. For best results, upload logo at 2x resolution for retina displays.
4. In Appearance > Widgets, add SoloFolio Captions and SoloFolio Social Media
5. In Appearance > Menus, create a menu with your pages.
6. In Appearance > Widgets, add a Custom Menu widget with the menu created in step 3.
7. Upload gallery images to fit 2100x1400. For blog posts, size to fit 900x600.

PS: Want to have a single, scaling image on a page? Insert a gallery and edit
the shortcode as follows:

[gallery ids="..." type="react"]
